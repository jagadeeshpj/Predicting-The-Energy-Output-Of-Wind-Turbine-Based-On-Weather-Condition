Predicting The Energy Output Of Wind Turbine Based On Weather Condition using Machine Learning
<br>
<br>
## Implementation

First Clone the repository: https://github.com/jagadeeshpj/Predicting-The-Energy-Output-Of-Wind-Turbine-Based-On-Weather-Condition.git
<br>
<br>
## Problem Description

Now, meteorologists have to manually take down every value and then calculate the
value for theoretical power. This is a very time taking process and there are chances
for human errors. As this decides how much energy will be produced, any kind of
error will cost a huge amount to the government. Also, there is no fixed formula for
calculating Theoretical power. They depend on a number of factors. Hence, we have
to come up with a solution such that the work for meteorologists is decreased and
also efficiency is increased.

## Expected Solutions

Our aim is to map weather data to energy production. We wish to show that even
data that is publicly available for weather stations close to wind farms can be used
to give a good prediction of the energy output. Furthermore, we examine the impact
of different weather conditions on the energy output of techniques to predict the
energy output of wind farms. We are building web app  to predict the energy output of wind turbine and weather condition of a city

## There are 4 main  steps in creating the web-app: <br>
 Step 1 - Data Preprocessing 	<br>
 Step 2 - Building Models <br>
 Step 3 - UI Integration 	<br>
 Step 4 - Hosting, Storage & Deployment <br>
<br>
